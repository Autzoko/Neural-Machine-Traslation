# Neural Machine Translation
Using Seq2Seq Architecture to translate sentences
from English to Chinese.

Just for fun.

## Problems
Because this program uses the **pkuseg** package
for word segmentation, however this package has problems
on version controlling and C++ compiling. The python
version that I use is python-3.9.13 which I suggest do
not supported by the pkuseg.

Lately I will test and debug the program on a server.
